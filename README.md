Yema Download (Google extension)
```

Have you ever download a move on a free movie websites and you are being interrupted by bunch of popups ,spam sites and redirection? 

well your not the only one

I was so frustrated that I had to find a way to bypass all those sites . well one would say you can use python selenium,but i just decided to try it another way


So I built this project called Yema download  , (A Chrome extension) 


These popups are triggered when you fire an event like a a click event any where in the dom. so  , instead of using the browser Dom to download ,the Google extension Dom is a great alternative 

This Google extension helps you download seamlessly using the Chrome extension API  thereby avoiding unneccesary and annoying popups and redirection


you can begin by registering the download button to the extension

this is a one time registration ,after which you would be able to download from the extension when you visit that same web page in the future


Well you can also use the extension to your preference not for only downloading film on free websites which was the initial idea




more instructions are there for you in the Chrome extension popup page
